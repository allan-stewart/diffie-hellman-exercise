# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Exercise

This repository contains a coding exercise to learn and try out a simple version of the
[Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) with small key sizes.

Objectives:
* Write some code to perform the key exchange using known values
* Calculate a key from an existing shared public value and use it to decrypt a message
* Perform a key exchange with another person an exchange messages
